Technical notes for V-Cruise file formats:

==== Polish-English vocabulary ====
???
PRZOD = front
OP (obróć w prawo?) = rotate right
OL (obrót w lewo?) = rotate left
SG (spojrzeć w górę?) = look up
GS (???) = look down?

PUSTYNIA = desert
MOST = bridge
BRAMA = gate
MUR = wall
SZTABA = bar
Dzwony = bells

==== Anims directory ====
*.avi: AVI video

*.txt: Animation metadata.  Format is significantly different between Reah and Schizm.  Might only be for export.
	Reah:
		First column is room number, second may be negative room number.  Negative room numbers lead to reversed animations.
		Next 2 columns are area frame ranges
		Next 2 columns are animation names to export
	

*.dta: Unknown, binary
	Seems to contain 2048 byte header section followed by 16-byte datas
	Data format seems to be:
		uint8: frame type.  In Schizm this is always 1.
			0x01: Keyframe
			0x02: Middle frame
			0x41: Last frame of animation
		uint24: frame index
		int8: room number or negative room number
		char[4]: area ID
		char[4]: decimal frame index in area

*.ta1: Animation name to frame range map, text
	Ranges are inclusive

*.tab: Unknown, text
	Appears to store consecutive ranges of room number values

*.morph: Unknown, binary (Schizm only)

==== Dta directory ====
*.dta: Unknown, binary (Reah only)
	Possibly same format as Anims directory (might be unused duplicates)

*.2dt: Frame positioning data
	16-byte blocks, one for each frame, format is:
		int32: x
		int32: y
		int32: z
		uint32: frame number in area

*.2tx: Frame positioning data for areas, text


==== Gfx directory ====
*.avi: Not actual AVI files, only contain single null byte

*.bmp: BMP images, unless they contain only a single null byte.  Language-specific UI files are separated by 100 in number.

==== Log directory ====
Dubbing.txt: Unknown, text

Index.txt: Unknown, text

*.log: Scripts, text, obfuscated using stream cipher

Speech*.txt: Subtitles, text

==== Map directory ====
*.map: Interactions map, binary
	First 16 bytes are header
	After that are 96*8 offsets, corresponding to 96 screens with 8 directions each.  The file offset for a screen-direction is 16+(8*screen+direction)*4
	At the specified offset is another 16-byte header.  If the first value is non-zero, then there are that many additional 12-byte data blocks for interactions.
	The interaction format appears to be:
		int16 top
		int16 left
		int16 bottom
		int16 right
		int16 interaction ID
		int16 object type


==== Sfx directory ====
Waves-*\*.wav: WAV audio, binary
	Sound effects, VO

*.sfx: Unknown, text
	Sound effect mapping data


==== Log scripting language ====
Appears to be stack-based

; - Comment until EOL

:Y:<identifier> - Pushes the slot ID of a variable
:<identifier> - Pushes animation identifier
<left animation> <right animation> rotate - Permits rotation via two translation animations
<animation> static - Scene is static and plays a fixed animation
0<number> - Pushes a hexadecimal number
d<number> - Pushes a decimal number
<range> rnd - Pushes a random number from 0 to range (??? exclusively?)
<value> dup	- Duplicates the value at the top of the stack
<value> drop - Does nothing (discards the value at the top of the stack)
<a> <b>	= Pushes true if a == b otherwise pushes false
<cond> #if - If cond is false, ignores tokens until #eif or #else
#else - If executed, ignores tokens until #eif
#eif - Terminates if/else block
<variable> yes@ - Loads a variable and pushes its value
<value> <variable> yes! - Sets a variable to a value
lmb - Terminates the script if it wasn't activated by a LMB press
lmb1 - ???
<value> #switch: - Searches for a corresponding case or #eswitch
#case: <value> - Resumes execution if the switched value matches the case
break - Skips execution to the next #eswitch
#eswitch - Terminates switch block
bit1! - ??? possibly sets a bit to 1
bit@ - ??? possibly reads a bit
say3 - ??? possibly plays a VO line
speed - ???
animR - Plays rotation animation (corresponding to the rotation direction for the interaction ID)
<screen> <direction> animS - decode a single frame from an animation and transitions to another screen
cursor! - Changes the cursor
changeL - ???
<anim> <screen> <???> <???> animF - ??? transitions to another screen?  Possibly also specifies rotation index.
:MOST_L0 <???> <???> sanimL
<anim> <screen> <???> anim - ??? transitions to another screen?
parmG - ???
<???> disc1 - ??? Used in multiple places, pushes a boolean
<???> <???> disc2 - ??? Only used in Room 11 in Reah
<???> <???> <???> disc3 - ???
DEC - Changes number parsing mode to decimal
HEX - Changes number parsing mode to hexadecimal
~ROOM <number> - Starts defining room
~SCR <number> - Starts defining a screen
~* <number> - Starts defining an interaction
	Area interactions start at 0a0 (decimal 160)
	Interactions 1, 2, 3, and 4 seem to be rotation interactions
<number> room! - Sets the room number.
	Importantly, this doesn't activate any screen in that room, some scripts set a room number, assign to a variable in that room, then change the room number back.
	To activate a screen, an op that causes a screen transition must be executed.
<sound ID> <duration> <new volume> <stop> volumeDn4
	Gradually reduces the volume of a sound.  Duration is in 10ths of a second.  If stop flag is set, then sound is stopped when volume transition completes.
